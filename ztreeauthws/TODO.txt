- NO AUTHORIZATION for treeauth web services! Is this an issue. Maybe not. For tree ws we needed 
authenticated_username to decide on allowed functionality (create links), filtering nodes when searching.
So passing 'authenticated_username' to ws not really authorization.
Maybe for treeauth not needed.

ISSUES
------

    (20110603)
    - deleting local user eg: joeb/delete deletes tree node and localuser obj, but leaves User obj.  On creating
      users we should search for existing User obj (by unique username) and point LocalUser to it.  So when deleting
      LocalUser we need to check if this last reference to User, and if yes, also delete the User rec.  So just a custom
      delete factory. (username should be unique not just across the site, but across the whole db/instance)

    - is has_perm, get_all_permissions needed in LocalUser

    - remove scomp content types from localuser Parents constraints in LocalUser model. Should not have to modify
      traversableauth model constrainst for every app. Need to be able to say LocalUser can live in any Traversable content 
      or something like.  Or maybe just rely on Children Constraints if no Parent constraints defined

    - clean up backend TraversableBackend.get_group_permissions(). XXX is it needed, should remove?
      or implement as Local/Remote .

    - do not return password on /get_user web service call - hash sensitive info prior to
      returning

    - /get_user hit on every request??? investigate maybe performance problem
      memcached could improve performance if this needed by allwing a GET /get_user?user_id=...
      and returning cached json msg without hitting db


IMPROVEMENTS
------------
    
    - add logging to authentication process front-end and back-end so can see what is going on
